My Timetable Zoom 2022 is a project created with the purpose of organizing my schedules for virtual Zoom classes.

Please note that the provided code is for exhibition purposes only and is specifically adapted for my computer, so it may not be suitable for direct use.

The main objective of My Timetable Zoom 2022 is to provide a convenient way to manage and organize schedules for Zoom classes. The application allows for entering class information such as subject name, schedule, Zoom link, and any other relevant details.

It is important to keep in mind that this project was created for personal use and tailored to a specific computer setup. To use it on another device, adjustments and modifications would be necessary.
